                <p>I am a budding full stack developer. I stumbled into this when my firm set up a laboratory for analyzing
                    field samples and then needed a database to keep track of all the data we generated. Since my firm couldn't
                    pay to have one made, I decided to build it myself. After a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, we had a
                    database in the cloud accessed through a web app. That project was a big help to the firm and the process
                    of making and deploying a full program like that helped me find my true passion in life: coding.
