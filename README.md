# Responsive Portfolio

[Visit site here](https://gregvx.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/)

This is a website to present some selected web apps I have built and posted to github. Some of the layout and formatting of this website were designed to meet specifications for an assignment for a cooding bootcamp I took at the U of U in late 2018 - early 2019. I also have a personal website at [www.gregvonarx.com](http://www.gregvonarx.com). Click the portfolio tab on either website to see some selected samples of my work.
